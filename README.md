# Real Estate in Austin, Texas

## Overview
Austin is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the U.S., with the population increasing by 34% in the past decade. The city offers great river access, hike trails, and entertainment. Residents from out of state have especially been drawn by the growing tech culture and relative low cost of living. As a result, the residential real estate market in Austin has been booming with prices increasing over the years.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to conduct an advanced exploratory analysis of Austin’s real estate data and display the results in an interactive dashboard, based on the following questions:

● Which factors contribute the most to housing prices?  
● Which areas of Austin have more expensive/affordable real estate?  
● When is house purchasing activity the busiest?  
● How has the median housing price changed over time?
